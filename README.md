# Stegonography

Steganography is an cryptographic technique that is used to hide information withing a digital file such as image.
In this repositary, you could find the stego file containing the code for steganography.
Edit the code with the image you want to use for hiding the message.
Python language is used for coding.
we have imported some libraries { CV2, OS, STRING }.
stego py need cv2 lib.
Before executing the code, make sure you install the cv2 in the cmd using  " pip install cv2 "
Then you can see an encryptedimage is created that contains the message inside the image.
If you check both the images, you won't find any differences in between them ,making it difficult to detect if any of the image contain any information.


Features:

1.Hide secret messages within images using pixel manipulation.

2.Passcode protection for secure decryption.

3.Lightweight and fast processing with minimal image distortion.

4.Works on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).

5.Uses OpenCV for image handling and manipulation.

6. Uses an simple programming language to implement this. ( can you other programming languages too ).
